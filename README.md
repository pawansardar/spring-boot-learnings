# spring-boot-learnings
Welcome to my Spring Boot learning journey! This repository contains a collection of hands-on mini-projects, concepts demonstrations, and code snippets that I've explored while learning Spring Boot.

Each folder represents a self-contained learning module, complete with its own code and explanation.

Each module contains a README.md file, which can be checked for more details regarding that particular module.

## Why this repo?
While building real apps, I realized there were many hidden but powerful features of Spring Boot that I never touched. This repo is my attempt to:
- Learn Spring Boot deeply, one concept at a time.
- Document my learnings for future reference.
- Help other devs who may have skipped these topics like I did.

---

## Topics I plan to cover
I'll cover lesser-known or often-skipped topics in more detail. Common ones (like basic REST APIs) will be summarized briefly to keep the focus on the learning roadmap.

---

## Note
These are **not production-ready apps** - they're minimal, focused examples to understand one thing at a time.

If you're learning too, feel free to explore, fork, or suggest something that I should add!
